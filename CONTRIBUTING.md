## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues and improve stability
- **Features**: Add new functionality
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **Performance**: Optimize existing code
- **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage

### Before You Start

1. Check the [issues](https://github.com/aravindkarteekr/react-cache-refresh/issues) to see if your bug/feature is already being tracked
2. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes
3. Make sure your changes align with the project's goals and scope

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Test in the test-app if applicable
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with a clear message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new cache invalidation strategy"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in cache cleanup"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots/examples if applicable
   - List any breaking changes

### Commit Message Convention

We follow conventional commits format:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type annotations
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

### Example Code Style

```typescript
// Good
export const clearCache = (options: CacheOptions): Promise<void> => {
  const { timeout = 5000, force = false } = options;

  if (force) {
    // Force clear all cache types
    return forceClearCache(timeout);
  }

  return standardClearCache(timeout);
};

// Avoid
export const clearCache = (options: any) => {
  // Implementation without proper typing
};
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

Currently, the project uses test applications for manual testing:

**Current Version (Local):**
```bash
cd test-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Previous Version (NPM):**
```bash
# From root directory
npm run test:prev:install
npm run test:prev
```

### Adding Tests

We encourage adding tests for new features:

1. Test your changes in the test-app
2. Verify functionality across different browsers
3. Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Documentation

### README Updates

If your changes affect usage:

1. Update the main README.md
2. Include code examples
3. Update API documentation
4. Add troubleshooting notes if applicable

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Include usage examples in comments
- Document any complex algorithms or logic
